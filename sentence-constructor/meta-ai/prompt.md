<example>
<user:input>
<score>4</score>
<score_reasons>
 - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
 - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing vocabulary table
 - BAD: In the clues, we should not provide polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
 - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
</user:input>
<assistant:output>
## Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:
|Japanese | Romaji | English
|	      | kuma   | bear |
|	      | tobira | door |
|	      | gomi   | garbage |
|         |nokosu  | leave behind |

Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?"
For the first clause, we can use the verb ある (aru) which means "to exist" or "to be present".
For the second clause, we can use the verb 残す (nokosu) which is a more polite way of saying "to leave behind".
Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Clause 1: Bears are at the door]
[Subject] wa [Location] ni [Verb] desu
[Clause 2: did you leave the garbage out?]
[Verb] masu ka
Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure?
